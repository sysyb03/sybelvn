							<span div class="image fit"><img src="images/Drone_Rend.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This project stands out as one of the most captivating experiences in my three years of study. Leading a collaborative team of 31 students from diverse engineering backgrounds—mechanical, civil, and electrical—, divided into five groups, we embarked on a mission to design an innovative delivery drone system. Our project covered not only the drone itself but also a specialized transport van and warehouse to store them, all driven by the shared goal of addressing a pressing societal issue: the limited access to essential resources in remote areas.</p>
							<p>My team's core responsibility centred on the design and development of the drone. We divided our tasks into distinct areas, focusing on the chassis design, propulsion system, and motor assembly. Our primary objective was to create a versatile drone weighing less than 20 kilograms, capable of efficiently transporting packages of up to 5 kilograms over a 30-minute flight duration.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Drone_ASS_DRW .JPG"width="10px" height="600px" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Our work started with the creation of a comprehensive Product Design Specification, outlining the essential criteria for the drone's form, function, and environmental considerations. This document served as our guiding compass, ensuring every design decision aligned with our mission and vision.</p>
						<p>For the chassis, we used the power of generative design in CATIA, crafting an initial blueprint that was later refined to meet our requirements. Each part of the drone was designed with manufacturability and ergonomics in mind. We opted for Flax as our chassis material, complemented by Nylon carbon fibre propellers, all documented in a comprehensive bill of materials that included manufacturer details and production methods. To ensure structural integrity, we conducted finite element analysis (FEA) simulations, rigorously testing the chassis for potential stress points and load-bearing capacity. This ensured that our design would withstand operational demands without bending or breaking.</p>

						<p>Our propellers, crucial to the drone's performance, underwent both computational and physical testing. We designed six rotors using Fusion 360 and 3D printed a pair for testing, followed by rigorous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in Ansys to optimize lift generation while balancing motor power requirements. FEA analysis was also employed to guarantee the resilience of our Nylon components under stress.</p>

							<p>As both team and group leader, this project presented a significant challenge: ensuring that the team worked cohesively, leaving no group behind. I am proud to say that through effective leadership and coordination, we successfully overcame this challenge and operated as a united and efficient team I personally worked on the management and design of the project, and the drone itself. I was responsible for the assembly drawing, manufacturing routing sheets, and drafting an entire business plan for the project. Additionally, I acted as a mediator between the groups, fostering effective communication and collaboration.</p>
					<p>What I loved the most about this project was the intersection between the different engineering disciplines, as well as it encouraged creative and critical thinking to adapt the design to the current societal needs and regulation. It was also a great opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired through my degree, in mechanical design, CFD and FEA.</p>
