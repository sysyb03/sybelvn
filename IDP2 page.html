							<h1 class="major">Carbon Capture Plant</h1>
							<p>In my second year, I had the opportunity to lead a team of six fellow engineering students in our second Integrated Design Project. Our mission? To  the improve the  design of a fictional Carbon Absorption plant, located for construction in Kolkata( India). We adopted a multifaceted approach, from comprehensive site research to pinpointing an optimal terrain for construction, to the meticulous design of important components like the Contactor unit, essential for carbon absorption, the Desorption unit, and the storage infrastructure of the facility. This project merged several discipline, tackling chemistry, physics, and mechanical design. As my first experience in team leadership, it was profoundly enriching, and I'm thrilled to say it was a resounding success, as our group earned an impressive grade.</p>

							<p>Essentially, a Carbon Absorption plant works as such: The carbon absorption plant works by pulling in ambient air using a set of powerful fans arranged within a contactor. Once inside, this air undergoes a process called desorption. Here, it mingles with an amine solution and experiences controlled heating and cooling cycles, which effectively separate the carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air. This results in a concentrated CO2 stream that's carefully collected and directed to a storage tank for further handling or secure storage. Meanwhile, the air that's now significantly reduced in CO2 content is released back into the atmosphere, fully purified and in compliance with environmental standards.</p>

							<p>Our design process went through several pivotal stages. To kick things off, as a team, we crafted a comprehensive Product Design Specification, to serve as a guiding compass to the project. We then divided up responsibilities evenly. In my role as the team leader, I shouldered the mantle of project management. This entailed establishing timelines, working on the CAD, and providing support to the team members with their research. This multifaceted position allowed me on touching several aspect of the project, from working on concept design and plans, to working as a middle-man between the professors and the team and making decisions.</p>
					
						<p>The initial step in developing the absorbing unit involved creating a conceptual design that outlined its core components and dimensions. Subsequently, a comprehensive research phase was undertaken, focusing on various elements including the fans, motors, shaft, coupling mechanisms, and materials. This research was informed by detailed calculations, determining critical parameters like volumetric rate, torque, and power requirements. Finally, suppliers were identified to obtain the components, taking into account their location and costs.</p>

							  <p>The design of the desorption unit was relatively straightforward, requiring less intricate planning than the absorption unit. However, it delved deeper into chemistry, particularly in the CO2 separation process. While we didn't need to source components from suppliers, I did take on the task of designing them using Fusion 360. The transmission and storage systems followed a similar pattern, with a focus on calculating factors like pipe pressure and length to ensure the secure containment of CO2 in its liquid state without any risk of leakage.</p>

  }

.image-column img {
  width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%; /* Allow the image to take up the entire column width */
 width: auto
}
</style>

<p>In terms of project management, I took the initiative to create a Gantt chart that provided our group with a structured timeline to follow. This proved to be a pivotal organizational tool, as it established clear deadlines and milestones for us to work toward. Thanks to this proactive approach, we not only met our project goals but also had ample time to spare before the submission deadline. Additionally, I fostered open communication within the team by organizing bi-weekly meetings where we discussed our progress, addressed any challenges, and ensured everyone was on the same page. In my role, I extended my support to my peers by assisting them with their research, which allowed me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the project. I took charge of all things CAD-related, from crafting intricate 3D designs to creating detailed drawings. All in all, this project was a fun one that allowed me to dabble in new areas, while practicing my CAD skills.</p>
